#  884.Uncommon Words from Two Sentences
Simple string operations, lexical analyze two sentences, and use a linkedlist to store tokens.
But under the circumstance that both two sentences are no longer than 200, head alloc-related operations in linkedlist are way to slow. So we can store it in local array, even hash it to lower the time usage. 

## Complexity

- Time, O(m + n) 
- Space, O(m + n)
